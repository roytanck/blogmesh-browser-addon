# Blogmesh
Blogmesh is an idea to make blogging more social. It uses (mostly) existing technologies to connect blogs into an impromptu decentralized social network. Currently, we're working on a proof-of-concept WordPress plugin and an accompanying browser extension (this repository).

## What is Blogmesh?

Blogmesh aims te make blogging more social, and in doing so create an alternative for existing social networks. The main idea is to connect existing blogs in a way that resembles other social networks, like Twitter. Simply follow your friends and see a timeline of their updates.

Because blogs are usually self-hosted, this means Blogmesh has the potential to become a decentralized network that belongs to its users, and where every user owns their own content.

Blogmesh uses existing, well-established standards like RSS. This means that many existing sites are already Blogmesh-ready.
